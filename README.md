Hello Dev Community,

my name is Murilo Puche, I'm transitioning my career from marketing with 7 years of experience in giant companies to developement.

But why?

First of all, I think in life we have to challenge ourselves as much as possible to reach new experiences and get a good tasty of how we can evolve as humans.
Thinking about that, I realized that I needed more challenges in my professional life. So I started this journey with Java.

Java has the most engaged community that I`ve ever seen before, people that are not interested in competition, but in helping out the community all over the globe.

I'm studying and implementing everyday to get better as a Java backend developer. This is what I'm passionate about, that's where I want to be to solve problems. I'm studying framework Spring and Spring Boot as well, facing challenges everyday and get more experience in this journey.

Here some tecnologies that I have experience with:

*Spring Boot
*Docker
*NoSQL
*Swagger
*Postman
*Heroku
*GIT
*REST APIs

If you want to see more about what challenges I've already get done, follow me. 

Thanks for read this.
