Hello Dev Community,

my name is Murilo Puche, I'm transitioning my career from marketing with 7 years of experience in giant companies to developement.

But why?

First of all, I think in life we have to challenge ourselves as much as possible to reach new experiences and get a good tasty of how we can evolve as humans.
Thinking about that, I realized that I needed more challenges in my professional life. So I started this journey with Java.

Java has the most engaged community that I`ve ever seen before, people that are not interested in competition, but in helping out the community all over the globe.
